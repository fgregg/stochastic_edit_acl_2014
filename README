Detailed description of everything comming soon...

Example:
Runs (0,2,0) topology with 
100 = training examples
.2 = .2 regularization coefficient
no = no backoff features 

./experiment020.sh 100 .2 no

Runs (1,1,0) topology with 
1000 = training examples
.5 =  .5 regularization coefficient
yes = with backoff features 

./experiment110.sh 1000 .5 yes
